# Herman Vulkers - Quote Clock

I created this app as a practice project to further develop my API integration, JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills. This code is the solution to one of the challenges developed by frontendmentor.io. They provided the raw materials, such as the text and the images. I did all of the codework.

## Overview

### Objectives

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with
- JavaScript (World Time API, Geo API, programmer quotes API, setInterval for clock refresh, toggleClass)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Through this project I got a better understanding of the way that API's can be used to fetch JSON data, and how this JSON data can be stored and used to manipulate the DOM. Additionaly, I learned more about setInterval, which can be used to make a page refresh at specific time intervals. There was also considerable time spent on the layout and responsiveness through CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](http://worldtimeapi.org/) - Documentation on their API helped me understand how to fetch userdata from their server.
